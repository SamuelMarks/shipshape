# Shipshape Delivery Checklist

- [x] Step 1: Gap matrix vs spec. Inventory modules in `/Users/samuel/repos/shipshape/shipshape-core/src/lib.rs` and `/Users/samuel/repos/shipshape/shipshape-cli/src/main.rs`; list missing spec components here.
- [x] Step 2: Expand repo intake modes. Add single URL input, directory batch, and local path audits in `/Users/samuel/repos/shipshape/shipshape-cli/src/main.rs`.
- [x] Step 3: CLI commands to match spec (`audit`, `refit`, `launch`) in `/Users/samuel/repos/shipshape/shipshape-cli/src/main.rs` and `/Users/samuel/repos/shipshape/shipshape-cli/src/mechanics.rs`.
- [x] Step 4: Mechanic orchestration in core (registry + command specs) in `/Users/samuel/repos/shipshape/shipshape-core/src/mechanics.rs` and `/Users/samuel/repos/shipshape/shipshape-core/src/lib.rs`.
- [x] Step 5: Health scoring + coverage heuristics in `/Users/samuel/repos/shipshape/shipshape-core/src/inspector.rs` and `/Users/samuel/repos/shipshape/shipshape-core/src/domain.rs`.
- [x] Step 6: Drydock heuristic upgrades (CMake + notebook-only) in `/Users/samuel/repos/shipshape/shipshape-core/src/drydock.rs`.
- [x] Step 7: PR template interpolator in `/Users/samuel/repos/shipshape/shipshape-core/src/pr_template.rs` and `/Users/samuel/repos/shipshape/shipshape-core/src/lib.rs`.
- [x] Step 8: Shipshape server (Actix + Diesel) in `/Users/samuel/repos/shipshape/shipshape-server/Cargo.toml` and `/Users/samuel/repos/shipshape/shipshape-server/src/main.rs`.
- [x] Step 9: GitHub PR + GitLab mirror workflow in `/Users/samuel/repos/shipshape/shipshape-server/src/workflows.rs`.
- [x] Step 10: Angular 21 UI in `/Users/samuel/repos/shipshape/shipshape-ui/angular.json` and `/Users/samuel/repos/shipshape/shipshape-ui/src/app/app.component.ts`.
